<h2>▶️	𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲:</h2> This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine. By analyzing a dataset comprising numerical features derived from PCA transformation, transaction time, amount, and fraud labels, we seek to mitigate the significant financial losses associated with credit card fraud. The project will employ a range of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to identify the most effective model for this task.

<li>👉🏼	𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝:</h2> Credit card fraud, a most of the time happening issue in the digital age, involves unauthorized use of credit cards for financial gain. As e-commerce and digital payments continue to proliferate, so too do the opportunities for fraudulent activities. This problem not only impacts individuals but also poses substantial risks to financial institutions and the global economy.   
<li>👉🏼	𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞:</h2> The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine. This model will serve as a valuable tool for financial institutions to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, thereby safeguarding their assets and protecting their customers.
<li>👉🏼	𝐒𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐞:</h2><br>
o	Data Acquisition and Preparation:<br> Obtain and preprocess the credit card fraud dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and imbalanced class distribution.
